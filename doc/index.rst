Caliper: Context Annotation Library (for Performance)
================================================================

Caliper is a generic context annotation system. It gives programmers
the ability to provide arbitrary program context information to 
(performance) tools at runtime. Alternatively, Caliper can be used 
as a stand-alone performance profile or trace data collector.
