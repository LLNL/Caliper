 *  \brief Variable-length integer encoding
 *
 *  This module contains functions to pack and unpack integer values
 *  using variable-length encoding. Variable-length encoding reduces the
 *  amount of bytes required to store small-to-medium values. Values
 *  smaller than 128 take up only one byte. However, for very large
 *  values, a few extra bytes may be consumed.
 *
 *  Encoding:
 *
 *  ~~~~~~~~{.c}
 *    uint64_t val1 = 1, val2 = 42;
 *    // Worst-case encoded size for one 64-bit integer is 10 bytes.
 *    // A 20-byte buffer will hold 2 values.
 *    unsigned char buf[20];
 *    size_t pos = 0;
 *
 *    // Encode values and advance the buffer positon
 *    pos += vlenc_u64(val1, buf);
 *    pos += vlenc_u64(val2, buf+pos);
 *
 *    // "pos" now contains the length of the two encoded values
 *  ~~~~~~~~
 *
 *  Decoding:
 *
 *  ~~~~~~~~{.c}
 *    uint64_t val1, val2;
 *    size_t pos = 0;
 *
 *    // Read two values.
 *    // vldec_u64() increases "pos" by the number of bytes read.
 *    val1 = vldec_u64(buf+pos, &pos);
 *    val2 = vldec_u64(buf+pos, &pos);
 *  ~~~~~~~~
