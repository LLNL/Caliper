/**
 * \brief Perform cross-process aggregation over MPI
 *
 * Aggregates snapshot records across MPI communicator \a comm. Each
 * rank provides a local aggregation database and configuration
 * (aggregation operators and aggregation key) in Aggregator \a a. The
 * aggregation configuration should be identical on each process.
 * When the operation completes, the result will be in Aggregator \a a
 * on rank 0 of \a comm.
 *
 * This function is effectively a blocking collective operation over
 * \a comm with the usual MPI collective semantics.
 *
 * \param db   Metadata information for \a a. The metadata database
 *    may be modified during the operation.
 * \param a    Provides the aggregation configuration and local input
 *    records, and receives the result on rank 0. Other ranks may
 *    receive partial results.
 * \param comm MPI communicator.

/**
 * \brief Initialize caliper-mpi library.
 *   Must run before Caliper initialization.
 *
 * Normally, the Caliper mpi library is initialized through a dynamic
 * library constructor in libcaliper-mpi.so, and it is not necessary to call
 * cali_mpi_init(). However, certain linker optimizations or static linking
 * can prevent a library from being linked if a library constructor is
 * the only entry point. In this case, call cali_mpi_init() from the target
 * application before initializing Caliper. It ensures that the Caliper mpi
 * runtime library (libcaliper-mpi) is correctly linked to the application,
 * and makes the mpi-specific services visible to the Caliper initializer.
